                <h3>As Physics Instructor at Udvash</h3>
                <P>
               Working as a Physics Instructor at Udvash Academic & Admission Care has been a highly rewarding experience. I taught and mentored secondary and higher secondary students, especially those preparing for board exams and university admissions. I focused on simplifying complex physics concepts using real-life examples and interactive methods to build students’ analytical skills.

I also contributed to lesson planning, model testing, mentoring weaker students, and fostering a positive learning environment. This role sharpened my communication, leadership, and teaching skills while deepening my passion for education and its power to drive change.
